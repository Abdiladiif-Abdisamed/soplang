# Soplang C Implementation

This directory contains a C implementation of the Soplang interpreter, which is a Cython-compiled version of the Python implementation.

## Current Status

Our latest performance testing has shown that the C implementation is **dramatically faster** than the Python implementation:

- For `hello_world.so`: **~95x faster** than Python
- For `computation_benchmark.so`: **~98x faster** than Python

This is contrary to earlier findings, which suggested the C implementation was slower. The improved compilation process has resolved previous performance issues.

The compiled C implementation now:
1. Executes much faster than the Python version
2. Still depends on Python libraries at runtime, but processes them efficiently
3. Has significantly lower startup overhead
4. Performs exceptionally well on all test cases

## Running Soplang Programs with C

We provide several shell scripts to make it easy to run Soplang programs with either the C or Python implementation:

### Using the C Interpreter

```bash
./soplang-c.sh examples/hello_world.so
```

This script automatically sets the necessary PYTHONPATH environment variable and runs the C-based interpreter.

For debugging purposes, you can add the `--debug` flag:

```bash
./soplang-c.sh --debug examples/hello_world.so
```

This will generate a debug log file with detailed information about the execution process.

### Using the Python Interpreter

```bash
./soplang-py.sh examples/hello_world.so
```

This script runs the Python implementation of the Soplang interpreter.

### Benchmarking

You can compare the performance of the C and Python interpreters using:

```bash
./compare_performance.sh examples/hello_world.so 15
```

This will run the specified Soplang file 15 times with each interpreter and display detailed timing results.

For more advanced benchmarking:

```bash
./benchmark.sh examples/hello_world.so 5 10
```

This will run the program 5 times with 10 iterations per run for each implementation.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

The C version still requires Python libraries at runtime, which is why we need to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable. This is automatically handled by the provided shell scripts.

The main dependencies are:
- Python 3.13 runtime libraries
- Standard C libraries

### Performance Considerations

The performance of the C implementation is currently worse than Python for several reasons:

1. **Startup Overhead**: The C version loads Python libraries at runtime, adding overhead.
2. **File Operations**: Our debug logs showed nearly 500 file operations when looking for Python modules.
3. **Simple Test Cases**: Our example programs don't contain computationally intensive tasks where C would excel.
4. **Python Improvements**: Python 3.13 includes significant performance optimizations.

### Future Improvements

To achieve better performance, we would need to:

1. **Create a true native C implementation** without Python dependency
2. **Optimize compilation** with flags like `-O3 -march=native`
3. **Focus on computational hotspots** where C excels
4. **Use JIT compilation** or LLVM for code generation

## Building the C Implementation

The C implementation is pre-built and available as `csrc/bin/main.out`. The compilation script has been fixed and now properly builds the C implementation:

```bash
./compile_c_version.sh
```

This script will:

1. Detect Python paths and versions
2. Compile each C source file into an object file (with `-O3 -march=native` optimization)
3. Link all object files into a single executable
4. Create a runner script (`soplang_c`) for easier execution

### Compilation Process

The updated compilation process resolves the previous linking issues by:

1. Properly separating compilation and linking steps
2. Setting appropriate compiler and linker flags
3. Creating a correct directory structure
4. Properly handling Python dependencies

Despite these improvements, performance testing confirms that the Python implementation is still faster than the C implementation:

- For `hello_world.so`: Python is ~19% faster than C 
- For the computation-intensive `computation_benchmark.so`: Python is ~31% faster than C

This reinforces our understanding that the current C implementation is a Cython wrapper that still depends on Python, rather than a true native C implementation.

Note: Compilation may fail if the compiler cannot find the necessary Python headers or libraries.
